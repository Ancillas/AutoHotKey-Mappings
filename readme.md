AutoHotKey Mappings
===================

These are some of my keyboard mappings that I use in Windows to make life on a smaller keyboard more bearable.

My XPS 15 9575 has a weird keyboard layout with, Home, End, and Delete on the top row and half-size keys for left and right arrows to accommodate half-size PgUp and PgDn keys.  This is maddening as I'm frequently hitting PgUp or PgDn instead of left or right.

These mappings attempt to make life a bit easier when working on this keyboard, and also add a few quality of life changes to more closely resemble my keyboard on my Mac.

I'm not sure how I'll fair when I use a full size keyboard with these mappings, so I'll likely try to find a way to disable this script when a full size keyboard is connected.

## Mappings

**Move one word left**

    Alt + Left

**Move one word right**

    Alt + Right

**Select one word left**

    Shift + Alt + Left

**Select one word right**

    Shift + Alt + Right

**Move to the beginning of the line**

    Ctrl + Left

**Select to the beginning of the line**

    Ctrl + Shift + Left

**Move to the end of the line**

    Ctrl + Right

**Select to the end of the line**

    Ctrl + Shift + Right

**Move cursor left**

This is purely to prevent PgUp from accidentally being pressed when trying to press the left arrow key.

    PgUp

**Move cursor right**

This is purely to preven PgDn from accidentally being pressed when trying to press the right arrow key.

    PgDn

**Delete character to the right**

This is personal preference for me.  I prefer Ctrl + Backspace for delete versus developing new muscle memory to reach the actual Del key on the 9575 keyboard.

    Ctrl + Backspace
